## Overview

Gender classification involves identifying the gender of an individual based on various input features. This project implements several machine learning and deep learning models to perform this classification with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It includes information about individual's Facial Structure Metrics such as length of hair, height of forehead, node width, node length, distance from nose to lip and other relevant features.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into the environment and any missing values were handled appropriately.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Incomplete or corrupted data points were removed, and potential biases were addressed by evaluating the data's representativeness.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic samples were generated to balance the dataset and improve the robustness of the model.
4. **Data Standardization**: Features were scaled to a common range to ensure each contributes equally to the model's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots were used to explore the distribution of features and identify potential relationships within the data. This step provided insights that guided feature selection and model training.

## Feature Engineering

The following features were considered in the model:

- **Facial Features**: Eye shape, nose length, brow shape, mouth width
- **Hair Style**: Hair length, color, texture, presence of accessories
- **Clothing Style**: Garment type, color, patterns, accessories
- **Body Shape**: Height, weight, posture, body proportions

## Models Implemented

The project implemented several machine learning and deep learning models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Fraction of correctly predicted positive cases among all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Fraction of correctly predicted positive cases among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing actual vs. predicted classifications.

## Results

- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest, with a test accuracy of 96.4%.
- **Comparison**: All models performed well, with minor differences in accuracy and precision.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The project successfully developed a gender classification system with high accuracy. Future work includes exploring advanced techniques like transfer learning and adversarial learning, as well as investigating the impact of additional data augmentation and feature engineering strategies.
